## Algorithm

Given a n x n matrix where each of the rows and columns are sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix. link:

[https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix)

1. use heap

```text
class Solution(object):
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix, k):
        heap = [(row[0], i, 0) for i, row in enumerate(matrix)]
        heapq.heapify(heap) //based on the first element
        ret = 0
        for _ in range(k):
            ret, i, j = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if j+1 < len(matrix[0]): //add the next element in the same row
                heapq.heappush(heap, (matrix[i][j+1], i, j+1))
        return ret
```

2. binary search

mid = \(min+max\)/2

try to find all the elements in each row smaller than mid. compare the number of elements, and adjust min/max.

```text
class Solution(object):
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix, k):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        low=matrix[0][0]
        high=matrix[-1][-1]
        while(low<high):
            mid=(low+high)//2
            total=sum(bisect.bisect_right(row, mid) for row in matrix)
            if total<k:
                low=mid+1
            else:
                high=mid
        return low
```

3. sort all elements

Timsort implemented in Python is capable of taking advantage of existing partial orderings. Moving sorted data in bulk is always faster than comparing and moving individual data elements, due to modern hardware architecture. Time complexity is the same because merging n sorted arrays of size n is still O\(n^2 \* log n\) in the worst case.

```text
class Solution(object):
    def kthSmallest(self, matrix, k):
        l = []
        for row in matrix:
            l += row
        return sorted(l)[k-1]
```
