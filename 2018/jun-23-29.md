## Algorithm

This week I studied an useful algorithm dfs, and the solutions to related questions in leetcode. It is usually implemented with recursion:

```text
dfs(current_node):
    if (current_node is target):
        return
    else:
        dfs(all connecting nodes to current_node)
```

One classic problem which can be solved using dfs is to find the subsets.

For example, to list all combinations of k elements from a list of size n, the general solution is:

```python
# start: current elements num in temp
# target: num of elements still need
def dfs(nums, start, temp, target):  
    if len(nums)-start < target:
        return
    if target == 0:
        # create a new temp list, not to push the original one
        result.append(temp[:])
        return

    temp.append(nums[start])
    dfs(nums, start + 1, temp, target-1)
    temp.pop()
    dfs(nums, start + 1, temp, target)


result = []
dfs([1,2,3, 4], 0, [], 3)
print(result)
# [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4]]
```

Dfs can also be used to solve graph related problems. Compared with bfs which is more suitable to find the best solution \(shorted path\), dfs can be used to check whether a solution exists, like whether a graph is connected.

Here is a blog talking about many problems can be solved with dfs in leetcode:

## Review

This week I read some articles talking about java, and here I summarized some notes about jvm and gc theory.
