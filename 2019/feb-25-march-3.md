## Algorithm

**Majority Element I**

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊ n/2 ⌋` times.

You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

**Solution:**

1. use dict to record the number of each elements, and find the majority element. O\(n\) time complexity, O\(n\) space complexity;
2. sort the list, and the majority number is the one in the middle;
3. use bit operation
