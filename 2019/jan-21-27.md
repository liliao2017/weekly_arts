## Algorithm

Description:

Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

You may assume that A has enough space \(size that is greater or equal to _m_ + _n_\) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are _m_ and _n_ respectively.

A = `[1, 2, 3, empty, empty]`, B = `[4, 5]`

After merge, A will be filled as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

class Solution {
    /**
     * @param A: sorted integer array A which has m elements, 
     *           but size of A is m+n
     * @param B: sorted integer array B which has n elements
     * @return: void
     */
    public void mergeSortedArray(int[] A, int m, int[] B, int n) {
        int i = m-1, j = n-1, index = m + n - 1;
        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
            if (A[i] > B[j]) {
                A[index--] = A[i--];
            } else {
                A[index--] = B[j--];
            }
        }
        while (i >= 0) {
            A[index--] = A[i--];
        }
        while (j >= 0) {
            A[index--] = B[j--];
        }
    }
}
```

Tip: instead of creating a new list and merge the original two from beginning, can merge the two from end and edit the list A in place.
