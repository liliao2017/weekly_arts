### Install vim

```text
apt-get update
apt-get install apt-file
apt-file update
apt-get install vim
```

1. install geoip module according to system version
2. download data file and specify the path in nginx config
3. log the location \(country name, city name, ...\) accordingly

### python for-else syntax

Answer from stackoverflow:

[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9979970/why-does-python-use-else-after-for-and-while-loops](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9979970/why-does-python-use-else-after-for-and-while-loops)

A common construct is to run a loop until something is found and then to break out of the loop. The problem is that if I break out of the loop or the loop ends I need to determine which case happened. One method is to create a flag or store variable that will let me do a second test to see how the loop was exited.

For example assume that I need to search through a list and process each item until a flag item is found and then stop processing. If the flag item is missing then an exception needs to be raised.

Using the Python `for`...`else` construct you have

```text
for i in mylist:
    if i == theflag:
        break
    process(i)
else:
    raise ValueError("List argument missing terminal flag.")
```

Compare this to a method that does not use this syntactic sugar:

```text
flagfound = False
for i in mylist:
    if i == theflag:
        flagfound = True
        break
    process(i)

if not flagfound:
    raise ValueError("List argument missing terminal flag.")
```
