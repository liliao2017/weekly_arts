## Algorithm

Description:

Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

You may assume that A has enough space \(size that is greater or equal to _m_ + _n_\) to hold additional elements from B. The number of elements initialized in A and B are _m_ and _n_ respectively.

A = `[1, 2, 3, empty, empty]`, B = `[4, 5]`

After merge, A will be filled as `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

```text
class Solution {
    /**
     * @param A: sorted integer array A which has m elements, 
     *           but size of A is m+n
     * @param B: sorted integer array B which has n elements
     * @return: void
     */
    public void mergeSortedArray(int[] A, int m, int[] B, int n) {
        int i = m-1, j = n-1, index = m + n - 1;
        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0) {
            if (A[i] > B[j]) {
                A[index--] = A[i--];
            } else {
                A[index--] = B[j--];
            }
        }
        while (i >= 0) {
            A[index--] = A[i--];
        }
        while (j >= 0) {
            A[index--] = B[j--];
        }
    }
}
```

Tip: instead of creating a new list and merge the original two from beginning, can merge the two from end and edit the list A in place.

## Tips

### varchar vs text

**`TEXT`**

* fixed max size of 65535 characters \(you cannot limit the max size\)
* takes 2 + `c` bytes of disk space, where `c` is the length of the stored string.
* cannot be part of an index

**`VARCHAR(M)`**

* variable max size of `M` characters
* `M` needs to be between 1 and 65535
* takes 1 + `c` bytes \(for `M` ≤ 255\) or 2 + `c` \(for 256 ≤ `M` ≤ 65535\) bytes of disk space where `c`is the length of the stored string
* can be part of an index

### Domain vs IP vs Host

An **IP address** is an identifier for a computer or device on a TCP/IP network. Networks route messages based on the IP address of the destination.  The format of an IP address is four numbers separated by periods.  Each number can be zero to 255. For example, 1.140.10.230 could be an IP address.   
  
A **domain name** is a name that identifies one or more _IP addresses_.  For example, the domain name _notifycorp.com_ represents several IP addresses.  Domain names are used in URLs to identify particular Web pages. For example, in the URL[_http://www.notifycorp.com/index.htm,_](http://www.notifycorp.com/index.htm,) the domain name is _notifycorp.com._

On the Internet, a **hostname** is a [domain name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) assigned to a host computer. This is usually a combination of the host's local name with its parent domain's name. For example, en.wikipedia.org consists of a local hostname \(en\) and the domain name wikipedia.org. This kind of hostname is translated into an [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) via the local [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file), or the [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) \(DNS\) resolver. It is possible for a single host computer to have several hostnames; but generally the [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) of the host prefers to have one hostname that the host uses for itself.

Any domain name can also be a hostname, as long as the restrictions mentioned below are followed. So, for example, both en.wikipedia.org and wikipedia.org are hostnames because they both have [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) assigned to them. **A hostname may be a domain name, if it is properly organized into the domain name system.** A domain name may be a hostname if it has been assigned to an Internet host and associated with the host's IP address.
